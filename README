configuration files for xmonad with .xmobarrc and .xprofile

LOCATIONS
==========
1. $HOME/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
2. $HOME/.xmobarrc
3. $HOME/.xprofile
4. $HOME/.Xresources.bkup

NOTE:
=====

1. One Arch and Nixos xmonad --recompile search in $HOME/.ghc for modules. 
Move .ghc out of the way if modules are installed globally. 
Not sure if a better work around exist.

2. On fresh install of Nixos, .xsessions and .xinit became inresponsive.
After following some advice from irc and reddit, .xprofile works fine.

3. Got to tinker with xmobar for volume and wlan connectivity. - todo

4. Xresources declaration is basically for transparency terminal .
