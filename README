configuration files for xmonad with .xmobarrc and .xprofile

LOCATIONS
==========
1. $HOME/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
2. $HOME/.xmobarrc
3. $HOME/.xprofile
4. $HOME/.Xresources.bkup

NOTE:
=====

1. One Arch and Nixos xmonad --recompile searches in $HOME/.ghc for modules. 
Move .ghc out of the way if modules are installed globally. 
Not sure if a better work around exist.

2. On fresh install of Nixos, .xsessions and .xinit became unresponsive.
After following some advice from irc and reddit, .xprofile seems to work fine.

3. Got to tinker with xmobar for volume and wlan connectivity. - todo

4. Xresources declaration is basically for transparency terminal (urxvt).
My personal font choice is inconsolata, redefine according to what is needed.
